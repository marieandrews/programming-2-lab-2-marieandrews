# Programming 2 - Lab 2

This template repository is the starter project for Programming 2 Lab 2. Written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### Questions

1. Write an if-else statement to compute the amount of shipping due on an online sale. If the cost of the purchase is less than or equal to $20, the shipping cost is $5.99. If the cost of the purchase is over $20 and at most $65, the shipping cost is $10.99. If the cost of the purchase is over $65, the shipping cost is $15.99.

   Example:

   Please enter the cost of purchase: $`60`  
   The shipping cost is: $`10.99`

2. Write a Java program that displays prime numbers until the number given as the parameter. You can assume that the number is positive.

   (Reminder: Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves)

   Example:

   Enter a positive integer: `25`  
   Prime numbers are: `2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23`

3. Write a Java program that return the following shape based on the number of rows as a string.

   Example:

   Enter number of rows: `5`

   `1`  
   `2 3`  
   `4 5 6`  
   `7 8 9 10`  
   `11 12 13 14 15`

4. Create an Account class that has the following properties.

   i) Three instance variables called accountNumber, name, and amount.

   ii) One static variable called numberOfAccounts.

   iii) A default constructor.

   iv) A constructor that takes all the parameters (that are necessary) and initializes them v) Getters and setters (accessors and mutators).

   vi) deposit() method that takes a parameter and adds the value to the amount.

   vii) withdraw() method that takes a parameter and reduces the value from the amount.

   viii) calculateInterest() method that adds %2 interest to the amount.

   ix) toString() method to show the values inside the object.

   x) equals() method to compare if two instances of Account class are equal or not.
